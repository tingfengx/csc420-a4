Since you are here, you should have already unzipped
the Assignment 4 zip folder...

To run code for Question 1, ```cd``` into the ```Assignment4``` folder
and run (since I used printing, better with the -u flag, which forces 
no caching for stdout.) 
``````
python3 -u q1.py
``````

To run code for Question 3, still ```cd``` into the right folder, and 
run 
``````
python3 q3.py
``````
three browser tabs should be opened up, with results corresponding to
three inputs provided.
